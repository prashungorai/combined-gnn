# Pre-trained Models

Pre-trained models provided in this directory can be used to predict the total energy of new crystal structures.

### Hybrid Model

* [hybrid_model.hdf5.tar.gz](hybrid_model.hdf5.tar.gz)
  
Hybrid model trained on DFT total energy of ICSD and hypothetical structures. Untar the file to obtain the pre-trained model in .hdf5 format.  

* [icsd_model.hdf5.tar.gz](icsd_model.hdf5.tar.gz)

Hybrid model trained on DFT total energy of ICSD structures. Untar the file to obtain the pre-trained model in .hdf5 format.
